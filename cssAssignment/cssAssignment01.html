         <span style = "font-size:25px;">You see it in the grocery store, while you're driving and even in the movies,
         cell phones have invaded almost all aspects of our daily lives.</span><br><br>The only place
         they haven't is in in the air. Could the use of mobile phones while in flight
         be the final frontier?  In many countries, it's already happening. Cell phones on planes have been
         in use in Europe for more than a year. In the United States, the Federal Aviation
         Administration and the Federal Communications Commission don't allow passengers
         to use their telephones on planes due to the phone signals possibly interfering
         with the plane's systems, as well as ground-based systems below.  Phones on planes have been around since the 1980s, with the introduction of
         the Airfone service, which was based on radio technology. The technology is
         still in use, but in 2006, Verizon, which acquired Airfone in 2000, announced
         plans to exit the in-flight phone business. The frequencies Airfone used have
         been auctioned to AirCell, a service provider that plans to use them to provide
         high-speed in-flight Internet.</p>
      
      <p>While such early technology was expensive to use, new in-flight mobile phone
         service in other countries is more on the order of international roaming fees
         -- around $1 to $2 per minute, <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2006/TECH/12/21/wired.airlines/index.html">CNN</a> reported.  Emirates Airline 
         became the first air carrier to allow cell phones on its
         planes in 2007, according to <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2006/TECH/12/21/wired.airlines/index.html">CNN</a>.
         The airline's system, supplied by AeroMobile, allows passengers to make and
         receive phone calls and text messages while at cruising altitude. Many international
         airlines have since followed suit.</p><br>
      
      <p class = myClass>How does in-flight phone technology work? What are some of the safety concerns
         with in-flight mobile phone services? Check out the next page to find out.</p>
      
      
      <h3>In-flight Mobile Phone Services Technology</h3>
      
      <p>Before talking about in-flight mobile phone services, let's look at how cell
         phones work on the ground.  Despite its name, a cell phone is a two-way radio. However, it's more sophisticated
         than a citizen's band radio or walkie-talkie.  CB radios and walkie-talkies are simplex devices, meaning they use one channel
         to communicate. Because they use one channel, only one person can talk at
         a time.  A cell phone, however, is a duplex device. It switches back and forth between
         two frequencies -- one for talking, or transmitting; the other for listening,
         or receiving.</p>
      
      <p>Will traditional cell phones work on planes? The New York Times reported that
         cell phones can be used in a flight's ascent and descent portions, but that
         their ability to work decreases as the plane climbs higher.  More airlines are adapting technology that allows passengers 
         to use in-flight mobile services.  As of September 2007, Airbus passengers could make and receive phone calls
         and send text messages using their cell phones while flying at about 10,000
         feet. The service cost passengers $2.50 a minute and 50 cents per message,
         the <a href="http://www.iht.com/articles/2007/06/19/business/mobile.php">International
         Herald Tribune</a> reported.</p>
      
      <p>The service provider, OnAir, uses special equipment to route calls and messages
         through a satellite network, which patches it into the ground-based network.
         The airplane crew controls the system and can limit or disable its use.  Pico cell technology allows passengers to use 
         their own cell phones on planes. Pico cells serve very small areas. In ground-based networks, they're used
         to serve areas such as a building's interior where signals are weak, or to
         boost network capacity. A Pico cell on a plane combines electronic equipment
         with an onboard antenna. The passengers' calls are sent to the central antenna
         and relayed to ground towers.  Even if in-flight cell phone service was available, it's not clear whether
         people would use it. A survey by travel management company Carlson Wagon-lit
         Travel showed that 61 percent of business travelers oppose using their phones
         in a plane. In response, airlines are looking at other ways to meet travelers'
         communications needs, such as high-speed Internet access.  <a href="http://www.aircell.com/">AirCell</a> helps U.S.-based airlines provide
         that service. The company's service allows passengers to surf the Internet,
         check e-mail and send attachments, as well as log into their office network
         from 35,000 feet.</p>
      
      <p>More airlines, foreign and domestic, are pursuing this option, too.  The <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/07/technology/06cnd-air.html?_r">New
            York Times</a>, in December 2007, reported some American airlines were
            offering in-flight Internet service. JetBlue Airways offers instant messaging
            while Virgin America and Alaska Airlines offer Web access. Experts predict
            in-flight Web access will be common within a few years.  <a href="http://www.aa.com/content/amrcorp/pressReleases/2007_08/01_connectivity.jhtml">American
            Airlines</a> also announced it would test high-speed Internet service for
            its passengers in 2008 on its Boeing 767-200 aircraft, which primarily
            fly international routes. The technology will use three exterior antennas
            mounted on the aircraft. It will rely on a network of cell towers throughout
            the United States.  American Airline officials said the service is for their customers who rely
         on PDAs and laptops for real-time information and communications.</p>
      
      <p>Even though wireless Web access could be used to make phone calls, most air
         carriers said they had no plans to allow voice communications. Airlines worried
         the chatter from cell phone users would annoy other travelers, while quietly
         browsing one's e-mail or surfing the Web wouldn't.</p>
      
      <p>Besides an increase in chatter, what are the actual safety concerns with in-flight
         mobile phone services? Check out the next page to find out.</p>
      <!-- here is text below the second picture: a man and a woman looking at a laptop -->
   <p class = myClass>The FCC and FAA have currently restricted cell-phone and e-mail use while in the air due to safety concerns.</p>
      
      <h3>Safety Concerns with In-flight Mobile Phone Services</h3>
      
      <p><img src="http://static.howstuffworks.com/gif/in-flight-mobile-phone-services-3.jpg" alt=""  align="right"/>
         In the United States, both the Federal Aviation Administration and the Federal
         Communications Commission regulate the use of mobile phones on aircraft.  Safety concerns exist for both the 
         cell networks and the airplane when traditional &quot;terrestrial&quot; cell
         phones are used in flight.  Because cell phones emit radio signals, government agencies worry that they
         can interfere with sensitive aviation electronics like communications equipment
         or the navigation system. Both of those systems rely on radio signals.  In the mid-1980s, when the first 
         commercial cell phone networks began operating,
         the U.S. government adopted rules prohibiting their use onboard commercial
         flights. The rules were based on the above concerns.</p>
      
   <p>On Sept. 11, passengers disregarded those rules when they called loved ones
         and law enforcement officials using both Airfone-type and traditional cell
         phone technology. Another safety concern, however, is that terrorists might
         use the signal from a cell phone to detonate an onboard bomb.  In spring 2007, the U.S. government decided 
         to continue its ban on in-flight
         mobile phone use. An FAA spokesman said the agency was reacting to public
         fears that the signals given off by cell phone might interfere with plane
         controls.</p>
      
      <p>Those fears might be well founded. <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/738470/US-says-no-to-in-flight-mobile-use.html">The
            Telegraph</a> reported that the British Civil Aviation Authority found
            up to 20 incidents between 2000 and 2005 where aircraft malfunction was
            related to mobile phone use.  Still, the European Aviation Safety Agency recently gave approval to OnAir
         to begin providing in-flight mobile phone service. The company's system uses
         phones that are less powerful than traditional cell phones aimed at avoiding
         such control interference.</p>
      
      <p>Many European air carriers plan to use mobile phones in aircraft. But the
         topic remains controversial, according to the Telegraph article.  The FCC bans the use of cell phones using the 
         common 800 megahertz frequency,
         as well as other wireless devices, because of potential interference with
         the wireless network on the ground. This interference happens as the planes,
         traveling several hundred miles per hour, leave one &quot;cell&quot; of mobile
         phone towers and enter a new one quickly.  The phones -- as well as any portable electronic devices such as iPods or
         portable radios -- also might interfere with the aircraft's navigation and
         communication systems. Therefore, the FCC bans their use during a flight.  Cell phones are a special concern in 
         that they're specifically designed to
         send out signals strong enough to be received at a distance.</p>
      
      <p>The FCC, however, has approved rules that allow in-flight voice and data services,
         such as broadband Web service, that use dedicated frequencies previously used
         by services such as Airfone.  An <a href="http://www.faa.gov/news/fact_sheets/news_story.cfm?newsId">FAA</a> fact
         sheet on the subject stated the agency's main fear is the unknown. The signals
         cell phones and other devices give off might effect critical aircraft systems
         over time. The FAA regulations prohibit most devices, though they specifically
         exempt voice recorders, hearing aids, heart pacemakers and a few others.</p>
      
      <p>In general, however, the FAA advises airlines that most personal electronic
         devices are safe to operate over 10,000 feet. This is mainly because any potential
         interference would be a more serious problem at a lower altitude.  In some cell phones, users can operate 
         in &quot;airplane mode,&quot; which
         disables the phone's transmitter but enables the passenger to use other functions,
         such as its calendar or games.  Which airlines offer in-flight mobile phone service, and which offer limited
         service? Find out on the next page.</p>

      <p>Some airlines already allow passengers to check e-mail or surf the Internet
         while in air.</p>

      <h3> Implementing In-flight Mobile Phone Services </h3>
      
      <p>Air France started with a limited service trial in late 2007, allowing passengers
         to send and receive text messages and e-mails.  The airline planned to begin
         allowing voice calls within the first three months of 2008, but said it would
         regulate call makers &quot;to maintain passengers'
         comfort and well-being,&quot; <a href="http://www.networkworld.com/news/2007/122007-air-france-launches-in-flight-cell.html?inform">Network
         World</a> reported.  Callers are allowed to use their phones only when the
         aircraft is 10,000 feet or higher off the ground. Other airlines, especially
         those based in the United States, allow limited use of cell phones while on
         the ground. <a href="http://www.aa.com/aa/i18nForward.do?p">American
         Airlines</a> and its subsidiaries, for example, allow use of cell phones during
         taxi-in, as signaled by an onboard announcement. Cell phone use is not allowed
         during flights, as doing so is against FCC rules.  However, several airlines
         are experimenting with a different cell-phone function -- using them as boarding
         passes. The International Air Transport Associations approved a method allowing
         airlines to send a barcode image to a passenger's cell phone in late 2007.
         The airline gate attendant can scan the image on the phone the same as one
         would scan a traditional paper board pass. With a projected 2010 start, advances
         such as these show that airlines and mobile phone technology will continue
         working together in the future [source: <a href="http://www.intomobile.com/2007/10/17/barcodes-on-mobile-phones-will-make-airline-boarding-pass-obsolete.html">Into
         Mobile</a>]. Along with such government rules, other issues, such as uncertain
         billing, customer service and service availability, keep airlines from providing
         full cell phone use onboard their aircraft in flight. For lots more information

      <h3>CELL PHONES AND AIRPLANE TEST</h3>

      <p>If you’re interested in an exploration of the safety issues posed by cell
         phones and personal electronic devices on airplanes, you might check this
         link. The Discovery Channel television show “Mythbusters” did an episode on
         cell phones and airplanes. The show found that there was no evidence of interference.
