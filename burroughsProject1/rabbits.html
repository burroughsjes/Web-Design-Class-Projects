      <h3>Introduction:</h3>
    <p>
      I've never had any pets before (besides a guppy that lasted for 2 weeks), and I definitely know when I get one, my first option would be rabbits. They're just so innocent and cute! And since I'm the type of person to always plan ahead, I went on to research my favorite types of rabbits. There were so many amazing options! I managed to narrow down the list luckily.<br><br>Below are my favorite breeds of rabbits.<br>

            <td> 
               Miniature Lops immediately caught my attention. There's actually many different types of lop rabbits – refer to the picture of an European Lop above – but I decided the Miniature Lops were my favorite. Its small size makes it extra adorable

            <td> 
                This rabbit caught my attention because of its ears. I thought those ears were more suited for deer instead of a rabbit. Then, the thought the rabbits becoming deer became extremely amusing to me. I love the variation in Eastern cottontails' coats.

            <td> 
               At first, I could not tell the marsh rabbit was a rabbit. Its ears were just so tiny! However, I did soon learn that marsh rabbits, are indeed, rabbits (and extremely cute rabbits, might I add). I love marsh rabbits.
