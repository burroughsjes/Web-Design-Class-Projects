      <h3>Introduction:</h3>
    <p>
      Music is a huge part of my life. I love producing music, and I love listening to it. For three years, I sang in a choir. For three years, I played the flute. For two years, I took singing lessons. For one year, I played the violin. I currently put my dedication in playing my piano, which I have been playing for nearly seven years.<br><br>I love music so much. As cheesy as it may seem, music becomes my escape from reality. I especially love important messages found within songs that can not be properly conveyed in any other medium, such as a book. Music brings life and emotion.<br><br>I recommend some of my favorite artists below with my top three favorite songs from them.<br>
