      <p style = "line-height:300%">Pat Lake is the founder of Pat's Pizzeria. Every since she was a kid, she dreamed of owning her own pizza shop. Her father was born in Italy and quite fond of pizza. When he immigrated to America, he brought several special Italian pizza recipes with him. He began his own pizzeria called Carlo's Pizzeria, but it went bankrupt and forced to shut down. Pat decided to follow in her father's footsteps and aimed to open her own pizzeria with a secret pizza recipe her father handed down to her. Pat thorougly enjoys making pizza and introducing her customers to new tastes they never imagined they would like. Unfortunately, we have lost Pat on 3 September 2007, but her passion and drive still lives in our hearts. We at Pat's Pizzeria promise to always treat all with kindness and respect while serving high quality pizzas. We aim to promote the wellness of others and to spread Pat's love for pizza to the world.</p>
